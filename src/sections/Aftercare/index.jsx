        <li>pat dry and apply a thin layer of aquaphor or a&d ointment</li>

        <li>take a break from any strenuous exercise to avoid trapping sweat inside the bandage</li>
        <li>after one week, switch to using an unscented moisturizing lotion for the next three weeks</li>
        <li>wear clean, loose fitting clothing around your tattoo</li>
